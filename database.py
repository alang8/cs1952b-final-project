    Oversees the secure archiving, retrieval, and deletion of attendance data, including private facial information. 
    Expert talks have emphasized the considerable worry of unauthorized data breaches and the need to limit the risk

    upon request complies with data privacy best practices and validates the necessity for flexible governance when 
    handling personal information in face recognition systems. This class has been improved to comply with strict 
    data protection standards and to better handle high-dimensional data structures used in facial recognition.
