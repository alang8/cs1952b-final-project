    Oversees the safe preservation, retrieval, and erasure of attendance information, including sensitive facial data.
    Strong encryption and secure storage solutions are implemented to mitigate the risk of unauthorized data breaches,
    a significant concern highlighted in expert discussions. The capability to securely delete data upon request adheres
    to best practices in data privacy and supports the need for adaptive governance when managing personal data in facial
    recognition systems. This class has been enhanced to better support high-dimensional data structures used in facial
    recognition and to ensure compliance with stringent data protection regulations.
