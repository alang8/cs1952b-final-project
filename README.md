**Final Project for CS1952B: Consent-Based Facial Recognition for Event Entry in China**

This is a design for a system (that would be used alongside policy changes) to revise the Chinese surveillance state to be more socially responsible.

Research paper: [Policy designs for adaptive governance of disruptive technologies: the case of facial recognition technology (FRT) in China](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/25741292.2022.2162248&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1714805317314362&usg=AOvVaw0Fbx9OaoaiHDBBrbHyKBYm)

Disclaimer: As it stands, the system is not 100% functional. Rather, it is a mix of pseudocode and code to showcase our design choices. However, being CS concentrators mainly versed in Python, we did research into potential libraries that could be used to make the implementation functional. In practice, we may consider using much more advanced options.
